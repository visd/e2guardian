Extended Room functions in e2guardian 3.1

The previous room function has been extended so that hosts in a room can have a
override list of urls with or without a blanket block function.

The perbannedroomdirectory directive in e2guardian.conf is replaced by
perroomdirectory, although for backward compatibility perbannedroomdirectory
will still work.

Each file in the rooms directory defines name, ip range and actions for that
room.

File format:-

1st line must contain a '#' followed by the room name

The following lines define the IP ranges, one IP or range per lines e.g.
172.167.58.3
172.167.59.1-172.167.59.65
177.167.60.0/255.255.255.0
177.167.61.0/24

End the list with:
#ENDLIST

Then optional whitelists can be added by using #SITELIST or #URLLIST
Each list must be ended with #ENDLIST

To block all access (other than listed in one of the above lists) use #BLOCK.

If #BLOCK is absent than the trusted sites listed will overide any block in the
users filter group.

So there are 4 cases:-

1. #BLOCK and no (#SITELIST or #URLLIST) - block all access
2. #SITELIST and/or #URLLIST and no #BLOCK - trust these urls and allow normal access.
3. #SITELIST and/or #URLLIST and #BLOCK - only allow these urls.
4. #SITELIST, #URLLIST, #BLOCK all missing - Legacy foramt file - block all access.

e.g.

#MyRoom
172.167.58.3
172.167.59.1-172.167.59.65
177.167.60.0/255.255.255.0
#ENDLIST

#SITELIST
site1.com
site2.net
#ENDLIST

#URLLIST
site3.com/url
site4.net/url
#ENDLIST

#BLOCK
