Changed/Added features in e2guardian 3.0.1 not found in Dansguardian 2.12.0.3

Words in CAPITALS are the corresponding pre complier directives.

Tuning settings introduced/changed:-
----------------------------------

- mapauthtoports conf option added - when off scans all auth plugs on every
  listening addr/port, when on maps auth plugins to addr/ports, default on.
- Added, nonstandarddelimiter per filtergroupe By frederic Bourgeois

- mapportstoips conf option added - when off listens on every filterports on
  every IP address,
- when on maps filterports to filterip's, default on

- maxlogitemlength now defaults to 2000. Unlimited option removed due to
  potential buffer overflow issues.


Logic Changes:-
-------------

Rewrite of main process loop to reduce dependency on select() call which limited
the number of child processes. Use of epoll() on Linux systems makes the engine
faster, more efficient and scaleable.

Note that the logic for handling SSL is changed. In DG when either blanket
block (or SSL blanket block) was active then an SSL site would not be blocked
if site name matched either exceptionsitelist or greysitelist. In e2guardian
with blanket block (or SSL blanket block) active an SSL site will only be
allowed if it matches exceptionsitelist or greysslsitelist. This ensures that
only trusted sites can be accessed via SSL. The greysslsitelist is used in order
to allow a site to drop through so that it's domain can be mangled via
urlregexplist, e.g. To use the Google mechanism for prevention of https Google
search, or to allow an SSL site whilst blocking the corresponding http: site.

Maxlogitemlength code moved into ConnectionHandler.cpp so as to prevent
very large URLs corrupting log messages and to lower load on inter-process
communication.

URL cache - Cache is now only checked (or added to) if URL is less than 2000
bytes and method is GET.

Emtpy list set issue fixed - was causes failure of logging and URLcache
processes when filtergroup was set to block all.

Authentication Plug-ins:-
-----------------------

Port based auth plug-in - filtering group assigned by destination port. To use
this feature mapauthtoports must be set to 'off'. Complied as standard.

DNS Authentication – PRT_DNSAUTH - DNS based auth plug-in for use with Protex
authentication system. To enable this use configure option --enable-dnsauth

New Lists:-
---------

Total Block List – TOTAL_BLOCK_LIST - Ability to read total block lists from
stdin on startup – List cannot be overridden. To enable this use configure
option --enable-totblock

Local Presidence - Local versions of lists added (localsiteexceptionlist,
localurlexceptionlist etc). LOCAL_LISTS. Logic flow changed so that all local
lists are checked before main lists so that they have presidence over main lists.
To enable this use configure option --enable-locallists

Search Word blocking – SEARCHWORDS – Specific search word blocking -
bannedsearchlist, bannedsearchoveridelist, localbannedsearchlist added.
Searchregexplist is used to extract search words from search engine url call.
The existing weighted search word block is also retained, but note that
searchregexplist is used instead of searchengineregexplist to determine a
search url and extract the search terms. Compliled as standard.

Referer Exceptions – REFEREXCEPT – Exceptions based on URL in refering url.
Refererexceptionsitelist and refererexceptionurllist added. Also
embededreferersitelist and embededrefererurllist. Compliled as standard. To
disable use configure option --enable-refererexception=no.

Add an http header based on url regex – ADDHEADER – addheaderregexplist – needed
for YouTube for schools. Compliled as standard. To disable use configure
option --enable-addheader=no.

Regular Expression Redirects – RXREDIRECTS – urlredirectregexplist – allows
browser redirection to different site. Compliled as standard. To disable use
configure option --enable-rxredirects=no.

Specific SSL lists added – SSL_EXTRA_LISTS – bannedsslsitelist , greysslsitelist
+ local versions. Complied as standard. To disable use configure
option --enable-sslextralists=no.

New Log Format:-
--------------

Logging – two new logfileformats have been added which are easier to parse than
the standard DG format.

5 – Protex format type 1 – Tab delimited, squid style format with extra fields
    for filter block/result codes, reasons, filter group, and system name – used
    in arrays so that combined logs show originating server.
6 – Protex format type 2 – Same format as above but system name field is blank –
    used in stand-alone systems.

Messages file amended:-
---------------------

Amendments to messages file – user and log messages have been made more
meaningful for the user and new messages added for the new list types
introduced. A version of the messages file with legacy worded messages is
provided as messages.alt (UKenglish only).
Translations are required into other languages, please submit these
to maintainer@e2guardian.org and these will be included in a future release.
